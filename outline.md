# Jobs throughout the year

PROMPTED - Someone should prompt you to do this, so you don't need to set a diary reminder.

## June

### Check timetabling for following year

**PROMPTED** (by Timetabling Officer): Check the draft timetable for your module. On [My Timetable](https://timetables.plymouth.ac.uk/)
you add the _module_ timetable to your own to ensure you see all sessions. Tell those already
known to be teaching on the module to check their personal timetables (this should include all
staff members but may not include TARAs / PhD students as they won't yet have been allocated to modules). 
_If your module has more than one module code (e.g. if it's part of both the UG and conversion courses)
make sure you check all module codes_.

### Attend exam board

**PROMPTED** (by Exams Officer / Faculty Office).
