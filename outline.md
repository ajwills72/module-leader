# Jobs throughout the year

## June

### Check timetabling for following year

Check the draft timetable for your module. On [My Timetable](https://timetables.plymouth.ac.uk/)
you add the _module_ timetable to your own to ensure you see all sessions. Tell those already
known to be teaching on the module to check their personal timetables (this should include all
staff members but may not include TARAs / PhD students as they won't yet have been allocated to modules).
